PomodoroStream is a productivity app that helps users study using the Pomodoro technique. Set custom timers and stay focused with soothing background sounds. Say goodbye to distractions and hello to productive study sessions with PomodoroStream.

## Why I made it?

I created PomodoroStream as a personal productivity tool to help me study using the Pomodoro technique. Whenever I encountered a problem or challenge, I used my technical knowledge to develop a solution that would improve my study sessions. I hope that this app can help others as much as it has helped me!
